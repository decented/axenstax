//! Asking the home router to forward the online-play UDP port.
//!
//! Most consumer routers speak UPnP IGD and will agree to this without anyone
//! opening a router admin page — which is the whole point: "no port forwarding
//! for most homes" (spec §0). A router that refuses is not an error, it is one
//! fewer candidate; the joiner still has IPv6 and STUN to try, and the host is
//! told plainly if none of them worked.
//!
//! The lease is **finite and renewed**, never infinite: a game that leaves a
//! permanent hole in somebody's router after it exits is not a good guest.
//! `PortMapping::remove` is called when hosting stops.
//!
//! Blocking API on purpose — this runs on a worker thread during the ≤3 s
//! candidate-gathering budget, so `igd-next`'s `aio_tokio` feature is off and
//! no async stack comes with it.
