//! Opening the hole, and racing across it.
//!
//! **The punch.** A home router will forward an inbound packet from an address
//! it has recently seen an outbound packet *to*. So both sides send a few
//! throwaway datagrams at each of the peer's candidate addresses before either
//! tries to connect. Nothing is expected back — the datagrams exist to teach
//! each router that this conversation is wanted.
//!
//! Punch datagrams are plain and unauthenticated on purpose: they carry no
//! secret, and forging one achieves nothing an attacker could not achieve by
//! sending any UDP packet. They arrive on the socket quinn owns, which drops
//! them as not-QUIC — so punching from a `try_clone()` of the server socket
//! (which is what makes the source port match the one quinn will connect from)
//! is harmless to the QUIC endpoint.
//!
//! **Nothing reads a punch.** Neither side has a receive path for them: quinn
//! owns the socket and discards anything that is not QUIC, which is exactly
//! what should happen to an unauthenticated datagram. The session id is in the
//! payload so a punch is recognisable in a packet capture, not so that code can
//! act on it — a parser here would be a parser for attacker-chosen bytes with
//! nothing to decide.
//!
//! **The race.** There is no way to know in advance which candidate will work,
//! so all of them are dialled, staggered 150 ms apart in priority order, and
//! the first to complete the ALPN handshake wins. [`ConnectRace`] is that
//! decision as a pure state machine — no sockets, no clock of its own — so
//! "first success wins, everything else is aborted, and there is never a second
//! winner" is provable in a unit test rather than hoped for at a playtest.
